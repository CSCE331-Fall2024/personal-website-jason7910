      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Jason Huynh and I am a computer science student at Texas A&M University. I am from the wonderful city of Austin, Texas. I am an aspiring software engineer driven by an undying passion for technology and its capabilities. My journey in the computer science space has been very rewarding, educational, and filled with challenges that have shaped me into a better student and developer.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        At Texas A&M University, I am completely immersed in a rigorous computer science program that challenges me to learn and grow every single day. Classes range from exploring complex algorithms to learning new technologies. Every class provides me with knowledge that will help me on my journey to becoming a proficient software engineer. I enjoy the intellectual challenges that each of my classes presents me with and I am always eager to apply my knowledge to practical applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        A significant milestone in my young professional career was my internship at Samsung Austin Semiconductor as a full-stack software engineer in the summer of 2024. In my role as a full-stack software engineer, I was able to take part in many real-world projects that impacted hundreds of users both internally to Samsung and externally. This amazing opportunity not only allowed me to improve my technical skills but also gave me insight into the industryâ€™s best practices, agile methodologies, and the importance of communication and collaboration in large-scale projects. This experience gave me a new perspective on software engineering. I realized that software engineering allows me to create solutions that can transform industries and benefit the lives of many.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        While my passion for software development and technology runs deep, I am a firm believer in a balanced lifestyle. Soccer has been an integral part of my life since I started playing at 6 years old. Soccer not only allowed me to stay physically fit and make lifelong friends but also taught me invaluable lessons about teamwork, hard work, and perseverance that directly translate to my academic and professional journeys.
